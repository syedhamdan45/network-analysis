# Network Analysis

Given a dataset of tweets, a hashtag is chosen (#vampirebite) and its network is explored and understood. The visualization of the network is done through NetworkX. The content is analyzed using the most common terms. The key players in the network are discovered using the following centrality measures:
1. Degree Centrality
2. Betweenness Centrality
3. Page Rank

The network connectivity patterns are also explored using cliques. A clique in an undirected graph is a subset of the nodes, such that every two different nodes are adjacent (directly connected with an edge).
